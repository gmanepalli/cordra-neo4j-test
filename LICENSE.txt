A) Cordra® (Version 2.5.0) License Agreement
========================================================================

© Corporation for National Research Initiatives 2023

1. This Cordra® (Version 2.5.0) License Agreement ("License Agreement") is
between Corporation for National Research Initiatives ("CNRI"), having an
office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA 20191, and the Individual
or Organization("Licensee") that has accessed, installed or otherwise used
the CNRI Digital Object Management software called Cordra® (Version 2.5.0),
the Cordra Software Technical Manual (Version 2.5.0), and its other included
documentation ("CORDRA(v2)"). Licensee shall be deemed to have entered into,
signed and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the License
Agreement upon such access, installation or other use.

2. Subject to the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, CNRI hereby
grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to use,
reproduce, analyze, distribute, perform and/or display publicly, and prepare
derivative works based on CORDRA(v2), and to authorize other to do so, in
source or binary form. CNRI and Licensee acknowledge and agree that CORDRA(v2)
has not been especially made or especially adapted to use in combination with
any particular software or product. Accordingly, CNRI shall have no liability
for or in connection with Licensee's use of CORDRA(v2) in any such combination.

3. Any exercise of the rights granted herein is subject to the following
requirements:

   a. CORDRA(v2) made available by CNRI to Licensee hereunder, and any software
      or other work that is based on or incorporates all or any part of CORDRA(v2),
      whether retained by Licensee, or made available to others, shall include
      CNRI's copyright notice and this CORDRA® (VERSION 2.5.0) LICENSE AGREEMENT
      in CORDRA(v2) itself at LICENSE.txt or in any derivative version thereof
      prepared by Licensee. The grant of these rights is further conditioned
      on Licensee's agreement to require every sub-licensee or other person
      or entity ("Other Party") authorized to exercise any of the rights
      granted herein to include CNRI's copyright notice and this License
      Agreement in similar fashion in any version of CORDRA(v2), modified or
      unmodified, that is used, reproduced, distributed, performed and/or
      displayed publicly, or adapted by such Other Party or by any licensee
      of such Other Party.

   b. Licensee hereby acknowledges that CNRI has included specific third-party
      software with CORDRA(v2) ("third-party software"). Licensee hereby
      acknowledges and agrees that this License Agreement conveys no right,
      title or interest to Licensee by CNRI in such third-party software
      and that it is Licensee's sole obligation to comply with all conditions
      of the licenses covering use of such third-party software. A list of
      the third-party software license agreements is included in CORDRA(v2)
      at LICENSE.txt and should be retained therein when CORDRA(v2) is used
      alone, or in any derivative version prepared by Licensee.

   c. If Licensee institutes litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that CORDRA(v2)
      infringes Licensee's proprietary rights, then this License Agreement
      and any license granted hereunder, shall automatically terminate as
      of the date such litigation is filed.

4. CNRI is making CORDRA(v2) available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. CNRI
MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE,
BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR USE. CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AND DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT
CORDRA(V2), AND ANY MODIFICATIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS THEREOF OR DERIVATIVE WORKS
BASED THEREON, WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE
SECRET OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT.

5. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR THIRD PARTIES FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSS OF
ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USER DATA OR PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, HOWEVER
CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO NEGLIGENCE AND INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS),
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE BASED ON OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE
OF THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS CORDRA® (VERSION 2.5.0)
LICENSE AGREEMENT, EVEN IF CNRI IS ADVISED OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. CORDRA(v2) provided to Licensee under this License Agreement may be subject
to export or import laws and/or regulations in the United States and in other
countries. Licensee agrees to comply with such laws and regulations and shall
be responsible for obtaining any and all required export and import documentation.

7. The License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of
its terms and conditions. The License Agreement does not grant permission to use
CORDRA, CNRI or other CNRI trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to
endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any third party.

8. To the extent United States Federal law is not applicable, the License Agreement
shall be governed by and interpreted in all respects with the law of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions, and the
courts within such State shall be the only courts of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in the License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.

fitness, in no event shall NAIST be liable for
any special, indirect or consequential damages or any damages
whatsoever resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether in an
action of contract, negligence or other tortuous action, arising out
of or in connection with the use or performance of this software.

A large portion of the dictionary entries
originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.

Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.

NO WARRANTY

The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
research and development conducted during the project and is provided
to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
any right of any third party.

Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
production of secondary products from the program.

In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
above as far as the program is concerned.
